# Excercise for the ISMRM Lecture on _Reconstruction of Non-Cartesian Data_

This notebook contains _built-in, live answer checks_! In some exercises you will see a coloured box, which runs a test case on your code, and provides feedback based on the result. Simply edit the code, run it, and the check runs again.
