# Exercise for the ISMRM Lecture on _Reconstruction of Non-Cartesian Data_

`Session: Image Reconstruction`

Live Q&A 5/16/2021 13:45 UTC


This notebook contains _built-in, live answer checks_! In some exercises you will see a colored box, which runs a test case on your code, and provides feedback based on the result. Simply edit the code, run it (`Shift` + `Enter`), and the check runs again as the notebook _reactive_: whenever you change a cell, all affected cells are evaluated, which will become important in Exercises 3-4.

Joint the live Q&A session if you have questions, or reach out via [email](mailto:jakob.asslaender@nyumc.org)!
